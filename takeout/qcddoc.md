# 1.Introduction  

## 1.1 background  

According to the investigation 10 percent of who order the takeout are in danger
The rapid evolution of the Chinese express industry has largely promote the development of the food delivery sevices in the catering industry. 
Thus, plenty of the new food delivery app was lauched to the market and now have owned millions of the users.  
(data)  
Whereas it also result in an increase in the concerns about the security problems exist during the food delivery services process.  
(data)  
  
One of the main reasons why users choose to order a food delivery is due to the convenience and time-saving since the it allow users to just wait for the food to come.
The common process of a user use the food delivery app to order a delivery services includes choosing items on the app, writing down the address, and waiting for the arrival of the food. The app will randomly release the delivery tasks to the deliveryman and also provide uses’ information including phone numbers, names, and the addresses.

The safety problems may occur during the process when the deliveryman give the food to the users. Those problems mostly are the violation from the deliveryman to the users, mostly come from such private environments of the transitions and the exposure of the users private information. Other problems including the food preservation and the stealing problems may also exist after the food has been delivered to the users’ ordering places.

In this project, we will specially focus on designing an high-tech receiving box which possess the techniques of the monitoring, temperature-controlling, and the anti-stealing, which would help to prevent the problems mentioned above and provide the users with a safer and more convenient food delivery experiences.

### 1.2.1 CURRENT APPROACH  

For the food delivery services, since the food cannot be stored as other normal goods, the products must be directly given to users face to face. This is because that the food tends to get metamorphism or lose its original quality. However, this face to face condition would carry out many potential dangers for both users and deliverymen. Thus, the most effective method to reduce the problems is to prevent the direct contact between the users and the deliveryman. 

The most common methods that people use to prevent the direct contact is to command deliverymen to put the products outside their doors or at the public places in their living buildings, and then go out and pick up the food after the deliverymen have left. Whereas this would also remain some potential problems. For instance, people cannot make sure that the deliverymen have really left or are still wandering nearby; the food can be stolen away; and if people don’t pick up their food immediately, the food would lose the original quality.

### 1.2.2  Existing approach and their limitation  


## 1.3 Objective  
Our objective is to provide our comsumer the safest way to get a takeout

# 2.METHODOLOGY  
## 2.1 OVERVIEW 
By placing a box out side the door so that the user do not need to get the takeout when the delivery is around. 

## 2.2 Hardware  
The product has insulation to keep the food at the right temperature so the user can get the food at its optimum condition.

### 2.2.1 Alarm 
The alarm system can first detect the position to know when to open the case for food to be put in. Also, it is able to call the police if the delivery is around too long.

## 2.3 Face recognition device
This device will identify the position of the delivery and provide realtime data to the display and the alarm system. This device will aid the ability of detecting if the delivery man is around. The device will locate the face and add a rectangle surrounding it. Then, a counter(able to alter at any time) is set to count the time of the delivery man in front of the door. In a normal context, a circle will appear as well as notifying the user, when the face recognition device finds the absence of the delivery man. On the contrary, if the man stands there for a long time, the alarm will be set on. An additional function will be to identify whether the person standing is a family member or not. This function will help knowing if the person is safe to the user or not. Then, the alarm would not trigger, if a family memeber is standing in front of the door. 

## 2.4 Processing  
At first, when the user has ordered the takeout, this section will track down the delivery and will also help the detection of the alarm system

## 2.5 User Interface  
Basicly, a display. This part of the product can remind the user, when the takeout is in the box and has not been taken.

# 3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
## 3.1 Assessment of Graph  
Face recognition
automatic lock

## 3.2 Assessment of Application  
Our main targets are the young generations as their parents has concerns over their safty as well as they might not be able to protect themselves.
