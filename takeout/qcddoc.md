# 1.Introduction  

## 1.1 background  
According to the investigation 10 percent of who order the takeout are in danger
The rapid evolution of the Chinese express industry has largely promote the development of the food delivery sevices in the catering industry. 
Thus, plenty of the new food delivery app was lauched to the market and now have owned millions of the users.  
(data).  
Whereas it also result in an increase in the concerns about the security problems exist during the food delivery services process.  
(data).  
  
One of the main reasons why users choose to order a food delivery is due to the convenience and time-saving since the it allow users to just wait for the food to come.
The common process of a user use the food delivery app to order a delivery services includes choosing items on the app, writing down the address, and waiting for the arrival of the food. The app will randomly release the delivery tasks to the deliveryman and also provide uses’ information including phone numbers, names, and the addresses.

The safety problems may occur during the process when the deliveryman give the food to the users. Those problems mostly are the violation from the deliveryman to the users, mostly come from such private environments of the transitions and the exposure of the users private information. Other problems including the food preservation and the stealing problems may also exist after the food has been delivered to the users’ ordering places.

In this project, we will specially focus on designing an high-tech receiving

### 1.2.1 CURRENT APPROACH  
Some invented a box for takeout to be put in, but this still cannot prevent reciever from danger

### 1.2.2  Existing approach and their limitation  


## 1.3 Objective  
Our objective is to provide our comsumer the safest way to get a takeout

# 2.METHODOLOGY  
## 2.1 OVERVIEW 
By placing a box out side the door so that the user do not need to get the takeout when the delivery is around. 

## 2.2 Hardware  
The product has insulation to keep the food at the right temperature so the user can get the food at its optimum condition.

### 2.2.1 Alarm 
The alarm system can first detect the position to know when to open the case for food to be put in. Also, it is able to call the police if the delivery is around too long.

This device will identify the position of the delivery and provide realtime data to the display and the alarm system.

## 2.4 Processing  
At first, when the user has ordered the takeout, this section will track down the delivery and will also help the detection of the alarm system

Basicly, a display. This part of the product can remind the user, when the takeout is in the box and has not been taken.

# 3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
## 3.1 Assessment of Graph
